# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Firefly Network project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when you're making a decision that:

- Affects the structure of the codebase
- Has long-term implications
- Involves significant tradeoffs
- Would be non-obvious to future developers
- Changes how components interact

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

1. **Title** — Short descriptive title
2. **Status** — Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context** — Why we need to make this decision
4. **Decision** — What we decided to do
5. **Consequences** — What happens as a result (positive, negative, neutral)

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy `000-template.md` to `NNN-title.md` (use the next number)
2. Fill in the sections
3. Submit a PR for review
4. Update status to "Accepted" when merged

## Index
