# ADR-002: Coinage (Private Payments) Integration

## Status

Proposed

## Context

ADR-001 established pUSD as the primary currency for the Firefly Network. However, pUSD transactions on Asset Hub are **publicly visible** — anyone can see:
- Who sent funds
- Who received funds
- The amount transferred
- The timestamp

For journalists in hostile environments, this transparency creates serious risks:
- Governments can identify who funds independent media
- Journalists receiving payments can be targeted
- Contribution patterns can reveal sources
- Diaspora supporters can face retaliation against family back home

**Coinage** is Polkadot's native private payment system that solves this problem. It provides:
- Anonymous coin holding (balances are private)
- Private transfers (sender/receiver identities hidden)
- Minimal information leakage (ZK proofs + ring signatures)
- Free usage for verified humans (People and Lite People)
- pUSD denomination (same stable value)

### How Coinage Works (Summary)

1. **Onboarding**: Convert pUSD → private coins via "recycler" with ring-VRF anonymization
2. **Holding**: Each coin held in a fresh, single-use public key derived from user's mnemonic
3. **Transfers**: Sender shares private keys off-chain; receiver "pulls" coins on-chain
4. **Recycling**: Coins with high "age" (transfer count) are recycled through rings to reset age and consolidate
5. **Offboarding**: Convert private coins → pUSD via recycler

Key properties:
- Coin denominations: $0.01, $0.02, $0.04, ... $163.84 (powers of 2)
- Coins have "age" — number of times transferred
- Age limits enforce recycling, which resets anonymity
- Verified humans (People/Lite People) get free transaction vouchers

### Alignment with Firefly Network

| Firefly Concept | Coinage Alignment |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| DIM Credentials (proof-of-personhood) | Required for free Coinage usage |
| Anonymous but Human | Coinage preserves both properties |
| Surveillance Resistance | Core design goal of Coinage |
| Information Bounties | Can be paid in private coins |
| Diaspora Contributions | Protected from government surveillance |

## Decision

We will integrate Coinage as the **privacy layer** for the Firefly Network's payment system:

1. **Dual-Track Payments**: Offer both public pUSD and private Coinage options
2. **Privacy by Default**: Use Coinage for sensitive payments (bounties, journalist compensation)
3. **Transparency by Choice**: Use public pUSD for treasury accounting, membership, and compliance-required flows
4. **DIM Synergy**: Leverage existing DIM integration for Coinage's free usage tier

### Payment Matrix

| Use Case | Default Mode | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Bounty Payouts | Private (Coinage) | Protect journalist identity |
| Journalist Salaries | Private (Coinage) | Protect recipient from targeting |
| Diaspora Contributions | Private (Coinage) | Protect contributor's family |
| Treasury Holdings | Public (pUSD) | Transparency for governance |
| Membership Fees | Public (pUSD) | Lower complexity, compliance |
| Alliance Settlements | Configurable | Outlet preference |
| Off-ramping | Public (pUSD) | Required for fiat conversion |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **True Privacy**: Not just censorship resistance, but actual anonymity
- **Journalist Safety**: Payments cannot be traced to recipients
- **Contributor Protection**: Diaspora can support without exposing family
- **Source Protection**: Anonymous bounty claims protect whistleblowers
- **DIM Synergy**: Existing identity system enables free usage tier
- **Polkadot Native**: No external dependencies, audited cryptography

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Two payment modes to support and explain
- **UX Challenge**: Private payments require off-chain key exchange
- **Liquidity Fragmentation**: Funds split between public and private pools
- **Off-ramp Friction**: Must convert to public pUSD for fiat
- **Denomination Constraints**: Powers of 2 require coin splitting

### Neutral

- Requires Coinage deployment on People Chain (in progress)
- Private payments have age limits requiring periodic recycling
- Free usage quotas may not cover all use cases (paid options exist)

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Add Coinage types to `@cocuyo/types`
- Integrate with existing DIM client for People/Lite People status
- Create `CoinageClient` abstraction

### Phase 2: Bounty Integration
- Offer private payout option for bounties
- Generate ephemeral keys for bounty escrow
- Implement off-chain key sharing via chat

### Phase 3: Journalist Payments
- Add private payment option for outlets
- Batch payment support with coin splitting
- Recovery flow for lost keys

### Phase 4: Full Integration
- Configurable privacy preferences per user
- Automatic public ↔ private conversion
- Privacy-preserving analytics
